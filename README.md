## Description
The Note Taker App is a full-stack web application that allows users to create, save, and delete notes to stay organized. This project was built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Bootstrap, and the Fetch API.

Users can add new notes, view previously saved notes, and remove notes they no longer need. The app communicates with an Express back-end server using the Fetch API to handle requests and store notes in a JSON file for persistence.

This project demonstrates how to build a simple CRUD application while practicing front-end and back-end integration.
